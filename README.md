# csgo-skinchanger
 My skinchanger for CSGO (only client side) to test the skins ingame.
 
 Reads/parses values from .txt file (skin ids, knife model)
 
 Every skin/kinfe is supported

 Obviously its not a complete project so you'd need a base and hooks of your own
 
 Thanks @BaberZz for his parser source
